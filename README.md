# ReplaceRhythm
Rhythm bot on discord came to a sad end due to Youtube restrictions but as a coder you develop your own.

# Required-libraries 
1.> PyNaCl

2.> discord.py

3.> Youtube_dl

4.> FFMPEG

# Other-requirements 
Also need to install FFMPEG with environment variables pointing to the bin folder of FFPMEG folder (for windows). Invite link for the bot is in text file .Token 

# Maddbot
Is a discord music bot , token is in codeitself (you may want it to be  private ) . Has functionality of play /pause/queue/stop ,
Use !play command followed by youtube url to add music. Bot is designed to join "General " chat of a server . Token gets changed anytime the token is posted on github so be sure to update your token from the discord-developer portal 

# Important points
1.> Bot only works while the python script is running .

2.> Bot downloads the mp3 file itself 

3.> Youtube_dl is very slow library and download speed can be as low as 25 Kb/s
